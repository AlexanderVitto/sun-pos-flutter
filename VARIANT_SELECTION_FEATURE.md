# Product Detail Navigation Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the POS application to allow users to tap on products and navigate directly to the product detail page, where they can view full product information including all available variants and add them to cart.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced POSAppBar Cart Badge (`lib/features/sales/presentation/widgets/pos_app_bar.dart`)

**Features Added:**

- ✅ **Tooltip with Price Summary**: Displays total items, variant count, and total amount when hovering over cart icon
  - Format: "X items (Y variants)\nTotal: Rp ZZZ.ZZZ"
  - Shows "Cart is empty" when no items
- ✅ **Variant Count Display**: Shows number of unique variants in cart
- ✅ **Variant Indicator Dot**: Small green dot appears when cart contains multiple variants (2+)
  - Located at bottom-right of cart button
  - Green color (#22c55e) with white border and glow effect
- ✅ **Currency Formatting Helper**: Added `_formatCurrency()` method for consistent number formatting

**Technical Details:**

- Uses `cartProvider.items.length` to get variant count (each cart item represents a variant)
- Uses `cartProvider.itemCount` to get total quantity across all variants
- Uses `cartProvider.total` for total amount calculation

### 2. Product Card Variant Indicator (`lib/features/sales/presentation/widgets/product_card.dart`)

**Enhancements:**

- ✅ **hasMultipleVariants Parameter**: New optional boolean parameter (default: false)
- ✅ **Variant Badge**: Purple badge displayed in top-right corner when product has multiple variants
  - Text: "Variants" with icon
  - Purple color (#8b5cf6) with shadow effect
  - Icon: `Icons.style`
  - Size: Compact (9px text, 10px icon)

**Visual Design:**

- Badge positioned absolutely at top-right
- Semi-transparent purple background with glow
- Minimal spacing to not interfere with product name

### 3. POS Transaction Page Integration (`lib/features/sales/presentation/pages/pos_transaction_page.dart`)

**New Functionality:**

- ✅ **\_handleProductTap()**: Simple navigation to product detail page
  - Navigates to `ProductDetailPage` when any product is tapped
  - Passes `productId` to the detail page
  - Works for all products regardless of variant count

**Flow:**

```
User Taps Product Card
    ↓
_handleProductTap() executed
    ↓
Navigate to ProductDetailPage
    ↓
User views product details, variants, and stock info
    ↓
User can add variant(s) to cart from detail page
    ↓
Return to POS page with updated cart
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Clarity**

   - Clear indication when products have multiple variants (purple badge)
   - Cart tooltip shows quick summary without opening cart
   - Green dot indicator on cart when multiple variants are present

2. **Efficiency**

   - Single tap on any product opens detailed view
   - All product information visible in one place
   - Variant selection happens in dedicated detail page with full context

3. **Information Density**
   - Cart tooltip shows items, variants, and total in compact format
   - Product detail page provides comprehensive information
   - Better context for decision-making

## Variant Selection Dialog (Available but Not Used in POS Flow)

The `VariantSelectionDialog` widget was created and is available for use in other parts of the application if needed:

### Features

- ✅ **Modern Dialog UI**: Clean, responsive dialog with rounded corners and purple theme
- ✅ **Auto-Selection**: Automatically selects first available variant with stock
- ✅ **Variant Cards**: Each variant displayed as interactive card showing:
  - Selection indicator (circular checkbox)
  - Variant name and price
  - Attributes (dynamic key-value pairs from API)
  - Stock information with color-coded warnings
  - SKU code
  - Status badges (STOK TERBATAS, HABIS, TIDAK AKTIF)
- ✅ **Smart Filtering**:
  - Active variants shown normally
  - Inactive/out-of-stock variants shown dimmed and disabled
  - Low stock (≤5) highlighted in orange

**Location**: `lib/features/products/presentation/widgets/variant_selection_dialog.dart`
