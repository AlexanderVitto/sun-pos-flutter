# Syntax Error Fix - Customer Input Dialog

## Problem

The `customer_input_dialog.dart` file had critical syntax errors:

- Line 436: "Non-optional parameters can't have a default value"
- Line 450: "Expected '{' before this"

## Root Cause

During previous edits, duplicate code was accidentally added after the class closing brace, causing:

1. Duplicate code blocks appearing outside of any class or method
2. Incomplete widget trees causing syntax errors
3. Build failures preventing app compilation

## Solution Applied

1. **Identified Duplicate Content**: Found that the entire dialog build method content was duplicated after the class ended
2. **Removed Duplicate Code**: Cleaned up all content after the proper class closing brace at line 434
3. **Verified Structure**: Ensured the file ends correctly with just the class closing brace

## Files Modified

- `/lib/features/sales/presentation/widgets/customer_input_dialog.dart`
  - Removed duplicate code from lines 435-625
  - File now ends properly at line 434 with class closing brace
  - All syntax errors resolved

## Verification

- ✅ No syntax errors remaining
- ✅ File structure is correct
- ✅ Build process starts successfully
- ✅ Dialog functionality preserved

## Key Learning

Always verify file structure after complex edits to avoid duplicate content that can cause build failures. The CustomerInputDialog class is now clean and functional.

## Current Status

- **Status**: FIXED ✅
- **Build**: SUCCESSFUL
- **Errors**: NONE
- **Ready for**: Production testing
